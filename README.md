# Blog-Website
-------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------
Hello everyone,
I am very glad to present my academic skills in the form of the project work which directed us to make a website named as ‘The Blog Website’ . As we know that a blog is a website where a person writes regularly about topics that interest them, usually with photographs and links to other websites they find interesting. There are many renowned Indian as well as International Blog Websites where we can see the most famous writers and authors too expressing their thoughts, ideas and enlightening certain topics that actually becomes the ‘Talk of the Town’ and gathers as many readers as possible.
	So by exploring my project you will be able to gather upon the basic idea of what a blog website actually look like. The making of the project helped us a lot in exploring the world of blogs. The website is well designed and carved by the skills of coding in the areas of HTML and CSS. I have tried my best to show up our html and css skills by using as many tags and attributes as possible. I have also inserted the images for its fascinating layout to attract the readers and have further attached some latest trending articles of current times. The website contains a ‘Login page’ where the user can log in and become a regular reader, the ‘Contact page’ refers to every way possible that you can use to contact the developer of the website and at last of the ‘Home page’ of the website we have attached a link that will directly take you the ‘Feedback Form’ fill up where we expect your valuable comments to help us improve better.
	Further this report contains all the list of the tags that have been used by us to create this website followed by the ‘Snapshots’ of the output that will give the preview best possible of our website and at last the ‘Link’ to jump directly onto the website has been attached.
